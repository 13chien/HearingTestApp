# HearingTestApp
The aim of this project is to develop a hearing test software/prototype on a mobile application 
that is meant for home use which would be able to detect malingering should there be any. 
The application would conduct a pure tone test where 6 frequencies from 250 hz to 8Khz (250hz, 500hz, 1000hz, 2000hz, 4000hz, 8000hz) would be played for 
the user independently on the left and right ear. The user would then select their lowest hearing capacity audible and this would be saved as their threshold. 
There would be a total of 12 hearing threshold stored and they would then be reshuffled and played back for the user to reconfirm.
